# AI-content-Solution-through-Google-AI
I'm looking to develop:

-I have a series of prompts I want to be strung together through Google AI
-Can also use OpenAI API
-Want ability to pull in research data from Perplexity API
-Need the ability to feed it custom brand data
-Need easy way to kick off the prompts (either a simple interface or instruction on how to do it)

I can map everything out, just need it strung together in the simplest way possible.

Essentially just looking for a proof of concept at this point
===============
To develop a simple proof of concept that integrates Google AI (or OpenAI), pulls research data from Perplexity API, and feeds custom brand data, we can create a Python-based solution that ties these components together with minimal effort.

Below is a basic Python code outline to get you started. It shows how you can string together prompts for Google AI or OpenAI, fetch research data from the Perplexity API, and feed custom brand data. You can trigger this process via a simple interface (for example, a terminal or a basic web interface).
Required Libraries:

    openai - for OpenAI API integration.
    requests - for making API requests to Perplexity API.
    flask - for creating a simple web interface (optional).

Install the necessary libraries:

pip install openai requests flask

1. Set Up API Keys

You will need API keys for OpenAI and Perplexity. You can get the API key from OpenAI and Perplexity.
2. Python Code

Hereâ€™s how you can set up the basic flow:

import openai
import requests
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

# Set your API keys
OPENAI_API_KEY = 'your_openai_api_key'
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY = 'your_perplexity_api_key'

# OpenAI API setup
openai.api_key = OPENAI_API_KEY

# Function to interact with OpenAI API
def get_openai_response(prompt):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        model="text-davinci-003",  # or another GPT model
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=200
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Function to fetch research data from Perplexity API
def get_perplexity_data(query):
    headers = {
        'Authorization': f'Bearer {PERPLEXITY_API_KEY}',
    }
    response = requests.get(f'https://api.perplexity.ai/search?q={query}', headers=headers)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        return {'error': 'Unable to fetch data from Perplexity'}

# Function to feed custom brand data into the prompt
def integrate_custom_data(prompt, custom_data):
    return f"{prompt}\n\nAdditional Context: {custom_data}"

# Combine everything into a single process
def run_prompt_chain(prompt, brand_data, research_query):
    # Fetch Perplexity research data
    research_data = get_perplexity_data(research_query)
    
    # If research data is found, append it to the prompt
    if 'error' not in research_data:
        research_info = "\n".join([f"- {item['title']} - {item['snippet']}" for item in research_data.get('results', [])])
        prompt += f"\n\nResearch Data:\n{research_info}"
    
    # Integrate custom brand data
    prompt_with_custom_data = integrate_custom_data(prompt, brand_data)
    
    # Get response from OpenAI based on the updated prompt
    ai_response = get_openai_response(prompt_with_custom_data)
    
    return ai_response

# Flask app to trigger the process via an interface
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/run', methods=['POST'])
def run_task():
    # Get data from the request
    data = request.json
    prompt = data.get('prompt', '')
    brand_data = data.get('brand_data', '')
    research_query = data.get('research_query', '')
    
    # Run the full process
    response = run_prompt_chain(prompt, brand_data, research_query)
    
    return jsonify({'response': response})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

3. How It Works:

    get_openai_response: This function sends the prompt to the OpenAI API (you can replace it with Google AI if necessary).
    get_perplexity_data: This function fetches research data from the Perplexity API by sending a search query.
    integrate_custom_data: This function appends the custom brand data to the prompt.
    run_prompt_chain: This function combines the research data and custom data and sends the final prompt to OpenAI to generate a response.
    Flask Interface: The simple Flask app exposes an endpoint (/run) that allows you to trigger the process via a POST request.

4. Example Usage (API Endpoint):

To trigger the prompt process, you would send a POST request to the /run endpoint with a JSON payload. Here's an example:

{
  "prompt": "Write a marketing plan for a new eco-friendly water bottle product.",
  "brand_data": "Our company values sustainability and targets eco-conscious millennials.",
  "research_query": "trends in eco-friendly products 2024"
}

Example curl request:

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/run -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "prompt": "Write a marketing plan for a new eco-friendly water bottle product.",
  "brand_data": "Our company values sustainability and targets eco-conscious millennials.",
  "research_query": "trends in eco-friendly products 2024"
}'

5. Running the App:

Once you've saved the code to a .py file, run it with:

python app.py

This will start a Flask server locally at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
6. Future Enhancements:

    More Complex Workflow: You can chain more AI models together or add logic to handle more advanced workflows.
    Enhanced Interface: Create a front-end (e.g., React or simple HTML) for easier interaction with the app.
    Security: Add API key validation, rate limiting, and authentication for your endpoints if you plan to deploy this publicly.

This provides a simple, proof-of-concept system where you can string together prompts with external data sources (like Perplexity), integrate custom data, and trigger it all with an easy-to-use interface.
